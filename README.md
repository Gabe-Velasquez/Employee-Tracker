  ## Description <a name='description'></a>
  This application was built to keep track of employees for a company's roster. It keeps track of departments, salary, manager and their role in the company as well. If your company grows to where you need new roles as well as departments, we have that covered for you! 

  ## Installation <a name='installation'></a>
  I installed inquirer and mysql2 for this project to work. A user would need node to have the application to start. 

  ## Usage <a name='usage'></a>
  The application will start with a list of choices going over adding employees, departments, and roles. You can also view departments, roles as well as employees. If there is an employee that changed roles, you can make adjustments under the "Update Employee" choice to get that settled.
